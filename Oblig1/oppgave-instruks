Full website with a menu for a café / restaurant

Create a simple webpage with a menu for a café / restaurant.
It should contain at least seven dishes, between three courses (f.ex. 'lunch', 'dinner' and 'snacks').
Several dishes should contain different allergens – and these must be easy for a casual reader to spot and understand.
Main ingredients or description for each dish
Example: 
Dish name: Entrecote a la Frydenlund
Description: Entrecote served with hashed potatoes, vegetables, and our Frydenlund beer-sauce [Milk/Lactose]
Easy to find opening hours, location and contact information
 

For an idea of how not to do accessible design, see https://www.elvebreddenkafe.no/menu/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

(But feel free to copy dishes, hours, and contact details from this page.) 


After you are done, and the page is up and running, submit it to an automated WCAG testing site, f.ex. WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (webaim.org)Links to an external site.


Based on the feedback you get, create a second version, and link them together so that we can see the difference.

 

Good luck!
