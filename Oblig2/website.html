                    <h2>Apple Watch Series 8: The Goldilocks Option</h2>
                    <h3>The best Apple Watch for most people</h3>
                    <p><b>BY ANGELA MOSCARITOLO</b></p>

                    <p>The Apple Watch Series 8 looks exactly like its predecessor,
                        but it offers some notable health and safety improvements that weren't available on
                    last year's model.</p>
                    <p>Its biggest upgrade is the ability to measure and track changes in your body temperature while you sleep
                        , with a dual-sensor design for more accurate readings. If you have a menstrual cycle, the Series 8 can use your
                        body-temperature data to estimate the date of your last ovulation. And on the safety front, the watch can detect
                        whether you've been in a car crash and automatically call for help.</p>
                    <p>With these upgrades, plus an already unrivaled user experience and app selection that's further enhanced by watchOS 9, the 
                        Apple Watch Series 8 is still the best iPhone-compatible smartwatch for most buyers and remains our reigning Editor's choice.</p>
                    <h4>APPLE WATCH SERIES 8 VS. ULTRA VS. SE</h4>
                    <p>Starting at $399, the Series 8 sits in the middle of Apple's smartwatch lineup, in between the rugged Apple Watch Ultra ($799) 
                        and the refreshed Apple Watch SE ($249).</p>
                    <p>The spotlight-stealing Ultra is meant for adventurers who want to veer off the beaten path, with outdoor-focused features 
                        including an emergency siren, more finely tuned GPS for improved location tracking off the grid, and a more durable design. 
                        The Watch SE, which forgoes an always-on display and some advanced health sensors but offers all the safety features 
                        of its pricier counterparts, is positioned as the more sensible choice for children, older adults, and budget-conscious buyers. 
                        That leaves the Series 8 as the best Apple Watch for everyone else.</p>
