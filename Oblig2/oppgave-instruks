We expect you to deliver with high quality. The best thing you can do for quality assurance, is to find a buddy so you can look through each other's code and give feedback.

As they probably want the same experience online as on PDF which is a simple layout for print. They have, however, made it highly dynamic online. This is an example of maintaining the same visual profile — but from a screen first-perspective. We want you to do the opposite.

 

Find a print article from a magazine. It should be two pages, with one main image, at least one supplemental image with image-text, a sidebar, and an introductory paragraph.

Your challenge is to create a mock-up/ high-fidelity prototype of how this could look online.

Imagine that there is some discussion about to what extent the publishing house should attempt to keep the print layout as much as possible (to maintain visual continuity and recognition) or re-design. Without spending time configuring the CMS, you are tasked with manually coding how this could look.

Your main objective here is not to make it pretty, but to copy the style as faithfully as possible. (Large screen version only.) Take a photo of the original, upload and link in so we can compare.

For this task, we shall look for even colours and fonts. Some tips: search for "hero image", which may come in handy, and search for "google fonts"; and “W3schools' colour-picker” may come in handy.

Good luck!
